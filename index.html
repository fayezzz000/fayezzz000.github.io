Cats love high places it makes them feel more dominat. <em>Cats created a meow sound secifically to commuicate with humans</em>. Most cats look down on their humans, <strong>cats think that they ar the master.</strong> Cats are extreamly clean cretures and love grooming themselves. Most pople who are <em>allergic to cats, are just allergic to cats saliva</em> and when cats bath themselves it gets on their fur<strong></strong>.</p>
